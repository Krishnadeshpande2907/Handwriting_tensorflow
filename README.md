## Requirements
- Python 3.10
- TensorFlow 2.10
- mltu package 0.1.5
## Installation
1\.  **Python 3.10**:
- Visit \[Python Downloads\](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and follow the instructions for your operating system.

2\.  **TensorFlow 2.10**:
- Refer to the following links for TensorFlow installation:
-  [TensorFlow Installation Guide\](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip)
-  \[TensorFlow GPU\](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow-gpu/2.8.0/)
-  \[TensorFlow CPU\](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/2.8.0/)

3\.  **mltu 0.1.5**:
- Install mltu package using pip:
```
pip install mltu==0.1.5
```
## Usage
1\. Clone or download the repository containing the Jupyter notebook.

2\. Open the Jupyter notebook.

3\. Ensure that all the dependencies, including Python 3.10, TensorFlow 2.10, and mltu 0.1.5, are installed.

4\. Run the code in the Jupyter notebook.

5\. The code will automatically download the dataset from the provided URL and perform operations on it.

6\. The dataset consists of images of handwritten text, with corresponding target text strings.

7\. The goal of the code is to perform handwriting recognition, converting handwritten text into machine-readable text.

8\. The Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function is utilized for handwriting recognition.
## Dataset
- Each sample in the dataset includes an image of handwritten text and the corresponding target text string.
## Handwritten Text Recognition with CTC Loss
Handwritten text recognition aims to convert images of handwritten text into machine-readable text format. This project employs a CNN model trained on the downloaded dataset.The CTC loss function is a crucial component in handling the variable length sequences of characters that are often present in handwritten text. It allows the model to learn effectively from the training data despite varying lengths in the text strings.
